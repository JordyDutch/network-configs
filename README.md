# LUKSO Network Configurations

This repository contains all [LUKSO Network](https://lukso.network/) blockchainâ€™s configurations. These configurations offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-application deployment, to simply load a configuration file with different methods to run the nodes. (eg. Binaries, Docker, etcâ€¦)

## Repository Structure

### Devnets - `devnets/`

Devnets are used to test new blockchain parameters, stress-tests and other configs before they will be integrated into the mainnet. They are not meant to run for long or extended periods of time, therefore they can be removed at anytime.

### [Testnet](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/testnet/parameters) - `testnet/`

Testnet is the official playground for blockchain developers to build dapps before deployig them on the main network.

The testnet is also used to test mainnet forks before applying them to mainnet.

### [Mainnet](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/parameters) - `mainnet/`

The configuration files for LUKSO mainnet.
